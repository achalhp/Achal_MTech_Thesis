    abstract = { The crystallographic characteristics of deformation twinning are derived by considering the atomic movements which occur at the moving interface as a twin propagates. This is facilitated by making use of the notation of the tensor calculus, and general expressions, valid for all crystal structures, are obtained giving the magnitude of the twinning shear and relating the twinning elements for both type I and type II twinning. The atomic shuffles, which in general must accompany the twinning shear in both single and multiple lattice structures, are examined in detail and expressions are derived for their magnitudes and directions for the cases of the four classical orientation relationships associated with deformation twinning. The use of these expressions in predicting operative twinning modes is described and the relations between this theory and other recent theories of the crystallography of deformation twinning are discussed. }

  abstractNote = {Beryllium, due to its unique combination of structural, chemical, atomic number, and neutron absorption cross section characteristics, has been used successfully as a neutron reflector for three generations of nuclear test reactors at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), the largest test reactor in the world, has utilized five successive beryllium neutron reflectors and is scheduled for continued operation with a sixth beryllium reflector. A high radiation environment in a test reactor produces radiation damage and other changes in beryllium. These changes necessitate safety analysis of the beryllium, methods to predict performance, and appropriate surveillances. Other nuclear applications also utilize beryllium. Beryllium, given its unique atomic, physical, and chemical characteristics, is widely used as a “window” for x-rays and gamma rays. Beryllium, intimately mixed with high-energy alpha radiation emitters has been successfully used to produce neutron sources. This paper addresses operational experience and methodologies associated with the use of beryllium in nuclear test reactors and in “windows” for x-rays and gamma rays. Other nuclear applications utilizing beryllium are also discussed.},
